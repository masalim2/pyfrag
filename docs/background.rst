Background
==========

PyFragment is a collection of Python modules that facilitate the setup and
parallel execution of *embedded-fragment* calculations on molecular clusters,
liquids, and solids.

Theory
------
The *embedded-fragment* methods are rooted in the many body expansion (MBE),
which expresses the total energy of a molecular system as

.. math :: E = \sum_{i} E_{i}
.. autofunction :: drivers.energy_driver

Implementation
--------------
A series of modules are available. Please check:
